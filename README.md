# sortMark
This program benchmarks three different sorting algorithms: Bubble, insertion and selection sort.

The program takes a file where the first line must have only one integer that indicates how many arrays are to be sorted.
Then each line represents an array composed by the leftmost integer meaning how many elements the array has and then the elements of the array itself.

This is a computer science project made for the Federal University of Santa Catarina.
